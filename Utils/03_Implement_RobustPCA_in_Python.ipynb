    "All the norms and matrix additions/summations/multiplications are elementwise operations so that they’re $\\mathcal{O}(np)$ given that our matrix $X$ is an $n\\times p$\n",
    " matrix. **_The major bottleneck of algorithms involving nuclear norm is that they typically require singular value thresholding which reqiuires SVD._** Since we’re computing a skinny SVD, the complexity will be $\\mathcal{O}(np\\min(n,p))$. SVD also requires to fit the entire data into the memory so it’s inefficient in that sense too. This can become a huge issue if you want to scale this algorithm and the literature has addressed this issue in certain ways which I hope to discuss in another post."
