One major website which shows many different types of matrix decomposition algorithms is the Matrix Factorization Jungle, run by Igor Carron. There has been a heavy focus on random projections in recent algorithms, which can often lead to increased stability and computationally efficient solutions.\n",

Using the GoDec algorithm, the background is almost completely subtracted from the noisy elements of people walking, while still capturing periodic background elements as part of the background.\n",

There are many datasets which can be found here, and we will set up a simple download function for ease-of-access. Special thanks to @kuantkid for the PyRPCA repo, which was the inspiration to start and extend this work, and especially the idea of creating a demo video from PNGs which is PRETTY. DANG. AWESOME."

The code below is an implementation of the Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier algorithm for Robust PCA which is identical to the equivalent MATLAB code (download), or as near as I could make it. The functionality seems equivalent, and for relevant details please see the paper. This algorithm was chosen because according to the timing results at the bottom of this page, it was both the fastest and most accurate of the formulas listed. Though it appears to be fairly slow in our testing, it is fully believable that this is an implementation issue, since this code has not been specifically optimized for numpy. Due to this limitation, we clip the algorithm to the first few frames to save time."
